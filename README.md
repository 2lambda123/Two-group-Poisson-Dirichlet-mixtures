# BNPTesting
This repository contains the scripts used in the article `Two-group Poisson-Dirichlet mixtures for multiple testing`,
where we propose to estimate the two components of the two-group model (Efron,2006) with mixtures of two-parameter Poisson Dirichlet Processes (2PPD).
In particular, you can find

  + The Rcpp code for the functions employed in the Gibbs sampler
  + The R code for the main function and some other auxiliary functions
  + A simple example, located in the subfolder `ExampleBNPT`.
